# Fanpage
live site: https://425megs.github.io/Fanpage/

## Description
This is my first attempt at a website prior to starting my coding bootcamp. <br>
The assignment was to create a fanpage of our favorite musician, list their albums in a \<table> and use a \<ul> to list our favorite songs.

Some above and beyond additions I did for this page include:<br>
-Making my own Favicon (the little icon that displays in the tab),<br>
-Having all the links open in a separate page rather than having the website redirect,<br>
-If you click on the album names, you'll be redirected to Spotify where you can stream each album.

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was that you can't adjust the opacity of the background image alone, it will affect the entire page since it is nested under the \<body> tag. Instead, I had to use some photoshop skills to manually adjust and upload the image from my computer rather than a URL!
